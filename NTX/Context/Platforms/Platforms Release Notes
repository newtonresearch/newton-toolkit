They contain a collection of Newton system definitions, proto template definitions, constants, function help text (which appears at the bottom of the evaluate or script slot editors or inspector window when the function name is typed), a number of utility functions, and definitions for constants that reference the functions. The constant that represents a function is the function name with the prefix k and the suffix Func (that is, kfunctionnameFunc).The platform file functions are available at compile time; you can make them available at run time by incorporating them into your application in one of two ways:¥	Call the function with the NewtonScript call syntax or the Apply function. This strategy saves space and time, because it does not require a slot in the base view and avoids inheritance lookup; it also works in code that doesnÕt have access to your base view, such as the remove script. Here is an example of using the call syntax to call a platform file function:call kNewInfoFunc with (arg1, arg2);There is a separate document which describes in detail all of the functions supplied by the platform files.For each platform file there is a corresponding "Defs" file.  The Defs file is a reference text document which lists the definitions of all of the constants which are defined in the platform file.  Included in these constants are the Magic Pointer  constants which use the @num syntax.To update a project that was created with a previous version of a particular platform file do one of the following:1) replace the previous platform file in the Platforms folder with the new platform file, and give the same name as the previous version.  Then start NTK and open your project.or2) put the new platform file in the Platforms folder (with a different name then the previous version), start NTK, open the project and change platform files from the project settings dialog from the project menu. Where to Find the Latest Platform filesSince the platform files contain utility functions and fixes for both the Newton ROM and Newton Toolkit itself, they are updated periodically and released to developers independently of Newton Toolkit.  The latest platform files can be found in the developer areas in the following locations:AppleLink:        Newton, Newton Developer Info        (this area is accessible by Newton Partners, Associates, and Associates Plus only)WorldWide Web:        http://dev.apple.info.com/newtonftp:        ftp.info.apple.com, Apple_Support_Area, Newton_DevelopmentNewton 2.0 Release NotesSeveral proto templates (and their corresponding Magic Pointer constants) have been renamed since previous versions of the Newton 2.0 platform file were released.  Here is a list of the old and new names along with the Magic Pointer constant.previous name           new proto name             ------------------      ----------------------     newtshowbar          -> newtFolderTab              newtclockshowbar     -> newtClockFolderTab         protoCancelButton    -> protoLargeClosebox         protoRoutingSlip     -> protoActionButton          protoShowbar         -> protoFolderTab             newtentryviewrouting -> newtEntryViewActionButton  newtentryviewfiling  -> newtEntryViewFilingButton  newtroutingbutton    -> newtActionButton           protonewshowbar      -> protoNewFolderTab          protoclockshowbar    -> protoClockFolderTab        History of changes since version 1.0:1.1d6Change protoListView Magic Pointer constant name and make it private.Instead, the ListView proto template should use UnitReference('ListView,'protoListView).Make protoListView proto from the ROM extension (not the ROM proto)	and add its many methods.Make several MP's private.Fix kGetPartEntryDataFunc, kLaunchPartEntryFunc and kSetExtrasInfoFunc.Add newtFolderTab and newtClockFolderTab protos.Update protoThumbnail proto.Add newtStatusBarNoClose proto.Add protoThumbnailFloater proto.1.1d5Add kInkChar.Add newtEditView proto's optionsFlags slot values:	kNoOptions and kHasScrollersOption.Revised list of which Magic Pointers are private or public.Add kGetPartCursorFunc, kGetPartEntryDataFunc, kLaunchPartEntryFunc and	kSetExtrasInfoFunc functions.Add kMissingImportsFunc.Remove kRegEmailSystemFunc and kUnRegEmailSystemFunc.Make UR and UnitReference will now work with constant folding.Make UnitReference & UR build time instead of global functions.Make LocObj & GetLayout build time instead of global functions.Add helpString for DoProgress global function.Add 1 argument (unit) to InkOffUnHobbled helpString.Add helpString for Clicker global function.Add helpString for RegisterCardSoup and UnRegisterCardSoup global functions.	(methods in MessagePad platform file).Add helpString for GetShapeInfo global function.Add helpString for OffsetRect global function.Add helpString for Apply, Perform, PerformIfDefined, ProtoPerform,	ProtoPerformIfDefined.Change the default viewFont slot for protoInputLine to "EditFont12".Add a titleIcon slot to protoTitle.Add Drag and Drop methods to the Methods list.Deprecate the Expando protos.Add optional label slot to protoRichLabelInputLine.Add optional statusBarSlot slot to newtApplication.Add view slot defaults to newtStatusBar.Remove newtLabelSymbolInputLine, newtQBELabelInputLine, newtQBETextView,	newtROSymbolView, newtSmartPhoneView and newtSymbolView protos.Change the CancelRequest slot of protoTransport to take one argument: why.Add protoAddressPicker, protoClockFolderTab, protoNewFolderTab, protoCorrectInfo,	protoWordInfo, protoWordInterp, protoDragger and protoDragNGo protos.Add protoDatePopup, protoDateNTimePopup, protoDateIntervalPopup, protoMultiDatePopup,	protoYearPopup, protoTimePopup, protoAnalogTimePopup, protoTimeDeltaPopup and	protoTimeIntervalPopup protos.Add protoPrinterChooserButton proto.1.1d4Add platform file version id information to constants (platformVersion).Cleaned up the Magic Pointer constant names and capitalization.Add help strings for several functions.Add unit reference functions and help strings: UnitReference, UR,	DeclareUnit, DefineUnit, AliasUnit, AliasUnitSubset.Remove Magic Pointer import/export functions and help strings.Add help strings for several functions from Utility Function chapter of 2.0 NPG.Add help strings for several Entry functions.Cosmetic changes to existing help strings to match documentation.Constant folding functions are defined in the platform file install script	for now until it is done in NTK.Fix kUpdateNamesRouteScriptsFunc which is used by both	RegNamesSoupRouteScript and UnRegNamesRouteScript.Add kCardFileSafeRemoveLayoutFunc function.Remove Magic Pointer import/export functions: DeclareMagicPtrTable,	PkgMagicPtr, ExportMagicPtrTable.Add kSupplantSoupDefFunc function.Add test for valid packageName to kAddExtraIconFunc.Replace the locale-related functions.Fix default value for protoOverview HitItem slot.1.1d3Added back all Magic Pointers for now.

That fix has not worked properly since 1.1.  The fix was removed from the MessagePad platform file (1.4d5e), but will be added back into future versions once it works correctly.  For now, apps that use protoEndpoint must use the 1.1 MessagePad platform file to work properly on pre 1.3 MessagePads.Similarly, 5 API functions: kOpenRemoteControlFunc, kCloseRemoteControlFunc, kSendRemoteControlCodeFunc, kEnableIRModuleFunc and kGetSCCSideBFunc now call their correspond function if it exists in ROM, else they return nil (or [0,0,0,2,0,1,59,156,0,0,0,0] for kGetSCCSideBFunc).  These functions will be fixed to work properly once again in future platform files.1.4d4Add platform file version id information to constants (platformVersion).Add GetPartFrameSlot and SetPartFrameSlot APIs.Add function help strings for GetPartFrameSlot and SetPartFrameSlot.Change in the platform file install script.Add floating point exceptions constants.Fill out bottom row of tool palette by adding protoTextExpando.Cleaned up the Magic Pointer constant capitalization.Cosmetic changes to existing help strings to match documentation.Constant folding functions are defined in the platform file install script	for now until it is done in NTK.1.4d3Add MakePage and MakeBlock.Add MakeBinary.Add GetLayout.ProtoPrintFormat has MessagePad not 2.0 slots.Text slot is required for protoLabelPicker.Fix some font related slots.1.4d2Fix kstdButtonSpacing and ButtonBounds.Platform file now includes an installer frame for self intall/remove.1.4d1Fixed constants which are in the platform file and also in Constants.f(including kInfoDotChar).
